# Day 2 — Synthesis & RTL-to-Gates Flow

**Goal:**  
Take a Verilog RTL design, run synthesis (e.g. Yosys), generate gate-level netlist, and compare with RTL. Learn about timing, area, and how synthesis tools interpret your design.

---

## Topics covered

- RTL → gate-level synthesis  
- Yosys synthesis commands  
- Netlist generation  
- Post-synthesis simulation  
- Analysis of results (area, timing)

## Files in this folder

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `code/` | Contains RTL and testbench |
| `scripts/run_flow.sh` | Script to execute synthesis + simulation |
| `Makefile` | Targets: synth, sim, clean |
| `images/` | Screenshots, waveform/plots |
| `results/` | Generated netlist, logs, reports |

## Usage / Commands

```bash
cd Day2

# run the flow via script
./scripts/run_flow.sh

# or via Makefile
make synth
make postsim
