# Week 3 Task ‚Äì Post-Synthesis GLS & STA Fundamentals

## üéØ Objective
The goal of this task is to perform **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** after synthesis, validate the design‚Äôs functionality, and conduct **Static Timing Analysis (STA)** using OpenSTA.  
We aim to identify **critical paths, slack, and timing violations**, ensuring the synthesized design meets timing requirements.

## üß† Introduction to STA
**Static Timing Analysis (STA)** is a method to verify digital circuits without requiring simulation vectors. STA checks **all possible paths** between sequential elements to ensure data is captured correctly.

### üîπ Key Concepts

#### **Setup Time**
- Minimum time before the clock edge that data must remain stable at the input of a flip-flop.  
- If data changes too late ‚Üí **Setup Violation** occurs.

#### **Hold Time**
- Minimum time after the clock edge that data must remain stable at the input.  
- If data changes too soon ‚Üí **Hold Violation** occurs.

#### **Slack**
- Difference between **required arrival time** and **actual arrival time**:
\[
\text{Slack} = \text{Required Time} - \text{Arrival Time}
\]
- **Positive slack:** Path meets timing.  
- **Negative slack:** Timing violation.  
- **Zero slack:** Path exactly meets timing.

#### **Critical Path**
- The **longest path** between flip-flops or sequential elements in terms of delay.  
- Determines **maximum operating frequency** of the design.

#### **Clock Definitions**
- Clock period, waveform, and uncertainty are defined in the `.sdc` file.  
- Accurate clock setup ensures proper timing analysis.
